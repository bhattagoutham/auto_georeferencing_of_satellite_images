Src co-ordinates are the co-ordinates of the rectified image
Dst co-ordinates are the co-ordinates of the raw image

Intial 4 values are entered in the coords.txt file
src_x, src_y; dst_x, dst_y

Using which we form the homography.

Later we enter additional suppoting GCP's. 
Once finished, the final transformed image is shown along with its co-ordinate system.

For this demo we have taken a dummy example. We have two satellite images, we generate dummy co-ordinates for the rec_img. We apply the above process to generate the co-ordinates for raw_img
